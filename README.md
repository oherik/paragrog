# paragrog

The repo for Concurrent Programming at CTH, a.k.a. paraprog. 

While the repo name was indeed a typo, I won't change it since it has spawned a delicious new drink:

# Paragrog
## Ingredients
* Pinapple juice
* 1 pt. Fireball
* 1 pt. dark rum
* A splash of Angostura

## How to serve
Fill a glass about 3/4 the way with pinapple juice. Pour the Fireball into one shot glass and the rum 
into another. Splash a few drops of Angostura into the rum glass. Serve the juice glass decorated with a straw and with
both shot glasses on either side.

## How to drink
The glass of pinapple juice represents the critical section, and the two shots are two separate threads. 
And you know what happens when two threads enter the critical section at the same time? Oh yes. Pour both shots into the
juice simultaneously, and enjoy.
